# Rice Classification using Advanced Statistics and Machine Learning Methods

The rice seed type dataset which is used in this project is taken from Kaggle. The dataset provides information for two varieties of rice seeds, “Jasmine” and “Gonen”. Among the rice varieties included within the data set, the “Jasmine” rice variety is native to Thailand. Superior physical appearance, cooking quality, and grain aroma are the major characteristics of this variety. It is one of the finest qualities of rice found in Thailand, but the average yield level is low, around 66% of the world average rates. In contrast, the “Gonen” rice variety is native to Turkey. It is the third-highest average rice-yielding variety in the world. Turkish seeds are characterized by high germination energy and total germination rates than the standard rice variety. These sets of data are continuous and have been randomly taken with the following features

- Eccentricity: it measures how round the rice grain (ellipse) is. It varies between 0 and 1, with 0 meaning circle and 1 meaning ellipse.
- Extent: the degree of spread of the rice grain
- Perimeter: it is the circumference of the rice grain
- Roundness: the ratio of the area of rice grain to the area of rice grain with a maximum diameter
- Aspect Ratio: the ratio of width to height
- Class: 1 means “Jasmine” and 0 means “Gonen” rice variety
- All of these parameters were real-valued continuous.
